# BasicObject

BasicObject is built-in to Ruby 1.9. The class included with Carats is provided
for Ruby 1.8.x users. Considering the Ruby 1.9 has finally started to go mainstream,
this library is reapidly becoming obsolete and so it will probably be removed
in future version, say around Jan 1 2014.

It is not included in the common set of extensions loaded when calling `require 'carats'`.
