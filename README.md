## About

Carats are Facets written in C. This library is intended to be small
and focused on a few areas where having widely useful extensions
or additions to Ruby could greatly benefit from the speed boost
and/or to access the underbelly of Ruby itself.

Carats is a work in progress and is currently looking for contributors.
If you are a C and Ruby coder and would like to practice your craft
a bit this a great project to contribute to since all the work is in
very managable "bite-sized" pieces. Contributors are free to select 
from Facets as they like. Or even make a case for extensions that are
not yet in Facets. 

## Bounties!

To encourge contribution, some bounties will be offered. These are small
figure bounties, so don't expect to get rich off of them, but if a few
greenbacks can help motivate, so much the better.

Check out the [BOUNTIES](https://github.com/rubyworks/carats/wiki/Bounties)
page for recommended extensions and the rewards offered for their completion.
