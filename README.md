## Description

Carats are Facets written in C. This library is intended to be small
and focused on a few areas where having widely useful extensions
or additions to Ruby could greatly benefit from the speed boost
and/or to access the underbelly of Ruby itself.

Carats is a work in progress and is currently looking for contributors.
If you are a C and Ruby coder and would like to practice your craft
a bit this a great project to contribute to since all the work is in
very managable "bite-sized" pieces. To encourge contribution, some
bounties will be offered. These a small figure bounties, so don't expect 
to get rich off of this, but if a few greenbacks can help motivate, 
so much the better.

Contributors are free to select from Facets as they like. Or even offer
extensions that are not in Facets. But check out the [BOUNTIES](https://github.com/rubyworks/carats/wiki/Bounties)
for recommended extensions and the rewards offered for their completion.
